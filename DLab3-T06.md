# T06: Jevons' Paradox
By Boyi, Di, Jingsong

DLab Theme: Sustainable Cities

## Learning Goal
•	Understand and analyse Jevons paradox in the context of sustainable cities. 

•	Form recommendations for engineers in developing designs that bear Jevons paradox in mind

## Overview
This video explores the idea of Jevon's Paradox in the context of sustainable cities. Examples of the paradox are explained, including the addition of lanes to highways and the increased use of LED lights. Suggestions for engineers are made that help them avoid scenarios where increased efficiency lead to increased consumption.

2: Which of the following are examples of Jevons Paradox?
	
A. The increase using of environment-friendly bags instead of plastic bags. As a result, the total pollution due to the bags decrease.  
B. A company replaces the old heat-supply system into a more efficiency one. Because of the small increase of demand in heat. They use less energy in heating system in winter.  
C.  Efficient petrol decrease the cost of petrol and as a result, people drive more and thus use more energy overall

## Transcript
Jevons Paradox is the idea that technological progress increases the efficiency of resources, lowering their costs, but results in an increase in demand and an overall increase in consumption of those resources. Jevons proposed the idea in 1865 when he observed that increased coal efficiency from steam engines saw an increase in coal use in industry.

Efficiency is about maximising outputs and minimising inputs. Lower inputs reduce cost, and the law of demand states that lower costs lead to increased demand. An example of this is when grocery stores place discounts on items that lead to consumers purchasing more than they would have at the dearer price. While they may perceive their overall expenditure to be lower, they have in fact consumed more resources. Overall, the intention to reduce consumption has caused an increase in consumption. 

We define sustainable cities as those that are well planned, ecologically resilient and have efficient, scalable approaches to resource consumption. An example of when Jevons’ Paradox can prevent a city from developing sustainably is seen in highways. Highways are efficient ways for travellers to commute. By adding extra lanes to highways, it would seem that you would increase the efficiency of the highway. However, as more people realise the benefit of the highway, they begin to use it more and this leads to higher congestion than before. 

Another example is LED lighting. LED light use is nearing ubiquity in our daily lives.  LEDs consume 6 times less energy, last 15 times longer and have comparable brightness and cost to older, incandescent light bulbs. Street lights, house lights, office buildings and commercial buildings are seeing their incandescent lights replaced with low energy, long life LEDs. These cheap light bulbs, which you can pick up for less than $5 online, seem like the best option. But is that the only cost? This is where Jevon’s Paradox comes in. We can have cheap lights that are okay for the environment? Keep them on! Put them in your drawers, in your bath, light up the whole office floor! LEDs are seemingly leading to increased light consumption, and thus an increase in energy use. Their efficiency gains do not directly correlate to the energy consumption reduction. Perhaps engineers, economists and architects must work together to consider all ramifications of their use.  
 
We suggest that to reach the goal of a sustainable city, highly efficient technologies whose design overcomes the effects of Jevons Paradox must be employed. Engineers cannot simply consider product efficiency. They should be considering longer term, branching effects of their technological ‘improvement’. For example, if machines instead of people do the farming work in China, food harvest and processing efficiency improves. However, the energy required to run the machines is considerable, many people are out of jobs and the city must then attempt to account for their unemployment rates. 
To account for Jevons paradox, efficiency improvements must be so significant that even when demand increases, the overall energy cost is still less than with the previous technology.
